AMATH482: Computational Methods For Data Analysis
Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, 
engineering, and biological sciences. Brief review of statistical methods 
and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis, 
spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal 
mode decomposition, and image processing and compression.

This repository includes 5 projects from this course: de-nosing data, time-frequency
analysis, PCA analysis, music gener classfication and neural networks.
